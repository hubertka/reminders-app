# Reminders app (Table view demo 2)
A custom built clone of Apple's default Reminders app in iOS.

Started using the tutorial "Put UIDatePicker inside static UITableView" by Oleksandr Manenko.

This project was created to learn how to build different input interfaces in a standard iOS app interface. Specifically, the tutorial by Oleksandr Manenko used a static table view to introduce custom cell builds with labels, switches and accessory settings, as well as an embedded UIDatePicker element, and toggling the UIDatePicker between hidden and visible states. 

Beyond the tutorial, I have added toggling to section head elements ("Remind me on day" & "Remind me at location"), improved upon the transitions between hidden and visible states of elements (adding a section line during the hidden states), added detailing on date picker selected date (text colour changes), and added an alarm repeat table view (allowing the user to choose if the alarm will repeat or is single use).

The next projects will focus on building the "Remind me at location" features, specifically dealing with using a map view, location search, location pinning, geofencing, and notifications. The projects will be combined into the Reminders app to fully build the functionality to create a reminder on iOS.
